this class is about the git branching system 
it also have the some basic and usefull commands to perfom the branching system 
git branch -----it helps to show the git branch where currently now
git branch name of new branch ----it's helps to create the new branch to the git 
git checkout name of new brach -------to switch the branch from master to sub 


 we did the same process as day 1 class that is adding file to the new branch
  git add name of new file
  git commit -m "name of new file "
  git push origin name of new branch 
  
  
the new file add to the new branch  
 because the master branch is not able to add changes because it may damage the master code
 so we add code to the new branc after adding the changes we merge to the master after all changes 
 
we made changes the code of new branch through online
 from this we will goint to learn the fetch data to the local folder or local repo's 
 we will use 
 git fetch ------ it shows the how much of data is modified in central repo's 
 git pull origin name -----to pull the data from the central repo's 

we have to merge the data or files from the new brach to master branch by the process 
pull request ---- compare&pull request --- Merge pull request ---request--- cofrim merge 

again we have to check the master brach to check the repo's 
for that we done the same process 
git checkout master
git pull master
 done .......
